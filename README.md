## 🎓 Introduction

The **Puzzlebot Python Simulator** provides a 2D GUI-based simulation environment for differential-drive mobile robots. Designed by [Manchester Robotics](https://manchester-robotics.com), it is ideal for learning and teaching robotics fundamentals such as control algorithms, localization, and mapping using Python.

This simulator supports both standalone virtual robots and real Puzzlebot hardware via standardized topic communication.

It also includes simulation of different dynamiclal systems to learn control concepts such as Open and closed loop control, frequency anaalysis, system identification, etc.

## 🤖 Robot Configurations

JSON robot definitions located in the `hardware/` folder:

- `puzzlebot01.json`: Includes laser, LiDAR, servo, and marker sensors
- `puzzlebot_laser.json`: Laser distance + servo
- `puzzlebot_cam01.json`: Marker sensor for vision-based localization

## 🗂️ Communication Topics

Defined in each `.json` config file:

| Topic | Description | Type |
|-------|-------------|------|
| `VelocitySetR`, `VelocitySetL` | Wheel control commands | `puzz_msgs.Float32` |
| `VelocityEncR`, `VelocityEncL` | Encoder velocities | `puzz_msgs.Float32` |
| `Pose` | Estimated pose (must be set by user) | `puzz_msgs.Pose` |
| `LaserDistance` | Single-beam range measurement | `puzz_msgs.Float32` |
| `LidarScan` | Full LiDAR scan | `puzz_msgs.LaserScan` |
| `ServoAngle` | Servo motor angle in degrees | `puzz_msgs.Float32` |
| `markers` | Detected marker bearings/ranges | `puzz_msgs.MarkerBearingArray` |

Message definitions are found in `lib/puzz_msgs.py`. You don’t need to manually set `type`, `topic`, or `status` fields — they’re auto-handled.
